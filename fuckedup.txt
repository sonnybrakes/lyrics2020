i fucked up, more than once today
this is a fucked lyric as a test
and i fuck up, at least once a day

i fuck up, at least once a day
i fucked up at least once today

i fuck up, at once a day

i've been pushed around
i've been played the clown
i've been pushed around
i've been played the clown
i don't why
i'been pushed around
i've played the clown
life has got me down
i've been pushed around
i've been pushed around
just about as much as i'm going to be pushed around
i've been pushed around
i've been pushed around
about as much as i'm going to be pushed around
i'm going to hit the ground
don't push me down
i'm getting pushed around
don't let me down
i'm going to hit the ground
but i won't be pushed around
i'm getting pushed around
don't let me down
i'm getting pushed around
just about as much as i'm going to be pushed around
i'm going to hit the ground
but i won't be pushed around
i'm getting pushed around
i'm getting pushed around
just about as much as i'm going to be pushed around
